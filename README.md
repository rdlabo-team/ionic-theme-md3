# Ionic Theme Material Design 3

__This is still in the early stages of development and is not yet available for use.__

## Development & Testing

### Demo Application

The `demo/` directory contains an Angular application for testing and demonstrating the theme. To run the demo:

```bash
cd demo
npm install
npm start
```

### Visual Regression Testing

We use Playwright for visual regression testing to ensure consistent styling across all components. The test suite automatically captures screenshots of all routes in both light and dark modes.

#### Running Tests

```bash
cd demo

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug tests
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Update baseline screenshots (when intentionally changing UI)
npm run test:e2e:update
```
